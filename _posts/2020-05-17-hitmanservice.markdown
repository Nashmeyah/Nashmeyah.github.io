    The Sinara section was pretty fun, although the ActiveRecord CRUD was hard to wrap my head around, I know I just need more practice with it and I will get it. I liked learning about the RESTful routing, my favorite part about development is watching my work come to life. 
		With that being said, the curriculum I have learned in the past 3 weeks has allowed me to have successfuly completed a killer app. Literally... For my Sinatra project I wanted to build something that I would have fun with and that I would learn from rather than just get the project done. I decided to build an app for a killer to keep track of its victims. The reason why I chose to build those based off Killer and Victim, I really like playing video games such as thriller and action games. I also love crime stories whatever form they come in. 
		This app allows killers to create an account and create a new victim when desired, they can add information such as name, time of death, and their finals words. My app contains 2 models, Killer and Victim, Killer has_many victims. I kept the relations simple so I am able to understand how to build the app on my own and test my knowledge,  I also have future plans to build on this app and have it grow with more than just 2 models as well as add more functionality to it with the new information I will learn in the future.
