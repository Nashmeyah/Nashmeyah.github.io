    Flatiron bootcamp has been such an interesting time. We have pushed through so much information in such little time, we are all each amazed at how much we’ve learned and how much we know. A few of us were wondering how we were going to manage the first project, especially making an API request!! If you asked us to do that a month ago, we would respond to you “Where in the world would we even start with that process?!”. All in all I am quite proud of myself and how I did despite the stress. I finished the app in almost a day, figuring out the bugs was the main thing that held me back. It took me a few days to solve 2 bugs, eventually I managed to smooth things out!

	   My Api app I created is essentially getting your daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly horoscope based on your selection of zodiac. It takes you through the process in the following ways.

     1.     Greetings, and requests you to enter your zodiac sign or whichever sign you want to see.
     2. Proceeds to ask which option you want to see, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly. 
     3. It returns your horoscope information in current time. For example today is 4-17-20, it will return Daily Horoscope 4-           17-20. Same thing applies to the rest of the choices. 
     4.The program keeps running in case you wish to see other zodiac signs.

     I was worried about how hard this project would be like, but in all honesty it was quite fun. I enjoyed seeing the information I pulled come back when I requested it. As I was working on this project, I realized how each person was working on their project but asked for help to double check their work. This made me realize how we would be working together as a team in a company.  All-in-all the first project is done and I can’t wait to see what we will do with Sinatra.
