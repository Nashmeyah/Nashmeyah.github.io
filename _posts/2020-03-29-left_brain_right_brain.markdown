    I took a class in high school, Video Production was the name of it if i remember correctly. Senior year og highschool, this was the most fun I had in a class. The creativity, the isolation that allowed me to get lost in my work, as well as watching what I was working on come to life was immensely thrilling. This was the start of my love with computers.

    A couple months later, I watched a show called Nikita, the hacker in the show, I always ended up looking forward to see what her would do next more than the origianl story line and the main characters of the show. This was the start of my interest in Cyber Security.
		
		    College started, I began my Cuber Security classes, the thrill and the adrenaline when I cracl code, when i get passed a fire wall was always what someone else wanted from me and I didnt like the idea of technology, and Cyber Security was a bit dull, I realized I needed something that can keep my creative juices flowing but also work with computers.
				
				So, I thought computer science wans't for me, I continued my CS courses because I was close to getting a degree so I thought why not? There was one class, Web Development, this class is what I needed. My professor was amazing! He had perfect enthusiasm and didn't make the information boring, everything was so interesting. I learned JS, CSS, and HTML, every project I made was so fun and my professor noticed my improvement with code and said "Nashmeyah, with each project, you improme more and more. You will become an excellent Web Developer." I felt amazing and I loved the perfect bslsnce of being able to equally involve creativity and logic to be able to create websites.
				
				So here I am, I decided to do this bootcamp so I can grow my network as well as hopefully get a job I know I will have fun with, because my interest in Web Development grows more and more.
